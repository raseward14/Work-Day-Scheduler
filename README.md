# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description
The user navigates through a series of prompts to generate a random password within an acceptable window of lengths. The biggest challenge was working through the logic of producing the randomly generated characters, in a string, at a specified length.

Javascript is the primary language used. You will see two script files, my first attempt including random math functions with every prompt, and my final, more simplified script file focusing on one smaller for loop, utilizing the random generator line of code only once.

The remaining challenges came from Javascript syntax required to tie in the HTML document.
